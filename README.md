# NodeMCU-Interfacing-with-Sensors

In this repository there are codes which I used while interfacing ESP8266 or Node MCU with different sensors. 

For example:
In Soil-Moisture Sensor, the following connections were made:

A0 of Soil Moisture Sensor => A0 of Node MCU.       
VCC of Soil Moisture Sensor => 3V of Node MCU.       
GND of Soil Moisture Sensor => GND of Node MCU

There after uploading the code into Node MCU, in the serial monitor the analog values were read which were observed to increase or decrease with removal and adding of moisture to the soil.
Refer video for explanation.
